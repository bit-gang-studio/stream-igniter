<h3>How it Works</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Displays 3 conversation prompts</strong> at a time.</li>
    <li><strong>Refreshes one entry every 60 seconds</strong> to keep topics fresh.</li>
    <li><strong>Clicking on a prompt</strong> removes it instantly and refreshes a new one more quickly.</li>
    <li>The dock stays in <strong>OBS</strong> so you can glance at it while streaming without tabbing out.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using Stream Prompt While Streaming</h2>

<h3>1. Read the Prompts</h3>
<p>The dock will show <strong>three conversation starters</strong> at all times. These are designed to spark chat engagement and keep the conversation flowing.</p>


<h3>2. Let Prompts Refresh Automatically</h3>
<p>Every <strong>60 seconds</strong>, one of the prompts will automatically refresh. This keeps topics rotating naturally during your stream.</p>

<h3>3. Click to Refresh Faster</h3>
<p>Clicking on a prompt <strong>removes it immediately</strong> and refreshes a new one. This is useful if a topic isnâ€™t relevant or you need a new idea quickly.</p>
